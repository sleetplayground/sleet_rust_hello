### Contract Methods

The smart contract provides two main methods:

- **get_greeting()**
  - Returns the current greeting stored in the contract
  - Example: Returns "Hello" by default

- **set_greeting(greeting: String)**
  - Updates the greeting stored in the contract
  - Logs the new greeting
  - Example: Can set greeting to "howdy" or any other string

These methods allow you to store and retrieve a simple greeting message on the NEAR blockchain.


```sh
near call hello.sleet.near set_greeting '{"message":"❄️ Hello!"}' --accountId sleet.near

near view hello.sleet.near get_greeting
```
